            "The DSM is more qualitative in its descriptions, while the ICD is quantitatively based, and is therefore favoured in research due to its more specific approach.",
            "The DSM is primarily used in Europe and is free, while the ICD is used in the US and is very expensive.",

            "Despite a peak in diagnoses in the 1980s, this was not a true reflection of increasing cases and was largely due to cult-based hysteria and inappropriate techniques.",
            "The increase of DID cases was mainly due to more cases being found in the general public due to wider awareness of the disorder, with treatment through hypnosis and medication being shown to be successful.",

            "It highlights how drug-associated stimuli (CS) come to acquire potent conditioned properties by activating the mesoaccumbens dopamine projection, leading to craving.",
            "It explains how drugs activate mesoaccumbens dopamine projection which are then interpreted as potent stimuli, which is why people relapse months later.",
