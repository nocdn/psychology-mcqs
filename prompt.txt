Now, for all of those questions you just made for me, please structure all of these questions in an array of dictionaries (JSON format) like this:

[
  {
    "question": "The actual question as a string.",
    "options": ["Option 1 as a string", "Option 2 as a string", "Option 3 as a string", "Option 4 as a string"],
    "answer": "The actual correct option as a string (one of the options listed above)."
  }
]
